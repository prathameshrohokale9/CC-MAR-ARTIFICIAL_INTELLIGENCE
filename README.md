Object Recognition is a technology that lies under the broader domain of Computer Vision. This technology is capable of identifying objects that exist in images and videos and tracking them. Object Recognition also known as Object Detection, has various applications like face recognition, vehicle recognition, pedestrian counting, self-driving vehicles, security systems, and a lot more.

The two significant objectives of object recognition involve:

1.Identification of all objects that exist in an image
2.Filtration of the object that seeks attention

Techniques of Deep learning have been shown state of the art for different problems related to Object Recognition. Some of the generally used approaches of deep learning for object recognition are as follows:

1.ImageAI
2.Single Shot Detectors
3.YOLO (You Only Look Once)
4.Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks
